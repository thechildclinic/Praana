## Section 1: Welcome to Prana.ai

Namaste and Welcome to Prana.ai, from GreyBrain.ai!

Prana.ai is your personal digital guide to the art and science of pranayama (yogic breathing) and an introduction to mindful meditation through our unique **"Listen Mode"**. Led by Shanti, our calming and experienced virtual coach, Prana.ai is designed to help you:

*   **Cultivate Focus & Clarity:** Enhance mental alertness and concentration through breath and mindful listening.
*   **Achieve Relaxation & Balance:** Learn techniques to calm your nervous system, find inner peace, and achieve a harmonious balance.
*   **Increase Vitality & Well-being:** Boost your energy levels and achieve a greater sense of overall wellness.

Shanti provides clear, voice-guided instructions, personalized to your experience level and user type (adult or child), making pranayama and the concepts of meditation accessible, immersive, and enjoyable. Prana.ai emphasizes a hands-free, eyes-closed experience, especially when conceptually paired with Bluetooth breath sensors for pranayama, and enhances this with calming background music and dynamic breath sounds. Our "Listen Mode" is perfect for audible meditation during walks or quiet moments, helping you integrate mindfulness seamlessly into your life for sustained **focus and balance**.
